            <h3>Subject of study</h3>
            <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility -- as long as the subjects fall
                somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
                the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying of the ideas you submitted we were monst intrigued by
                 are as follows, in order of priorty:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and health benefits of Reveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C(86&deg;F), when the
                    audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>.)
                </li>
                <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading style sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research 
                to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
            </p>

            <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
            <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,
             my favorite dances are as follows, with definition:</p>

             <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
             <dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="BC">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around
             in a circle like chickensm to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</dd>

             <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
             <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a meansof getting warm, they used to practice this dace, which involved hudding close together in a circle on the floor,
                and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
                modern styles such as Twerking.
             </dd>

             <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
             <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by
                 "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this 
                 because they were really cold.
             </dd>

             <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="https://www.naver.com">exotic dance research page</a></p>

             <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
